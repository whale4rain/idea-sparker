# Implementation Plan: Inspiration Source Blog Writer

**Branch**: `001-build-an-application` | **Date**: 2025-09-28 | **Spec**: `/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-build-an-application/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)
```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:
- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary
[Extract from feature spec: primary requirement + technical approach from research]

## Technical Context
**Language/Version**: Go 1.22 (backend/eino agent), Rust 1.75 (Tauri desktop), React 18 (frontend)  
**Primary Dependencies**: eino framework (Go), Tauri (Rust), React with shadcn/ui components  
**Storage**: File-based storage (Markdown files, JSON metadata)  
**Testing**: Go test (backend), cargo test (Tauri), Jest/Vitest (React frontend)  
**Target Platform**: Windows, macOS, Linux (desktop application)  
**Project Type**: Web (Tauri desktop app with React frontend + Go backend)  
**Performance Goals**: <500ms AI response time, <100ms UI interactions, offline-capable core editing  
**Constraints**: Must support offline Markdown editing, real-time preview, cross-platform compatibility  
**Scale/Scope**: Single user desktop application, local file storage, cloud sync optional

## Constitution Check
*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Core Principles Compliance
- [⚠] **Go-First Development**: Backend uses Go/eino (compliant), but desktop UI uses Rust/Tauri/React (deviation - see Complexity Tracking)
- [✅] **Desktop-First UX**: Primary interface is native desktop application with responsive UI and real-time Markdown preview
- [✅] **Test-Driven Development**: TDD approach with failing tests before implementation (all layers)
- [✅] **Markdown-Centric Data**: User content stored as Markdown files with JSON metadata for citations
- [✅] **Inspiration Source Integrity**: Accurate attribution tracking with export to multiple formats (Markdown, JSON, CSV)

### Desktop Application Requirements
- [✅] Native platform conventions followed (Tauri provides native window management)
- [✅] Real-time Markdown preview supported (React-based live preview)
- [✅] Citation management interface implemented (link collection and organization)
- [✅] Search/filter capabilities included (for managing inspiration sources)
- [✅] Export functionality provided (Markdown, HTML, PDF via Tauri printing)

### Development Workflow
- [✅] Code reviews mandatory (all PRs require review)
- [✅] Static analysis passes (golangci-lint, clippy, ESLint)
- [✅] Integration tests pass on all platforms (Windows, macOS, Linux)
- [✅] Performance benchmarks established (AI response time, UI performance)
- [✅] Documentation updated with code (inline docs, user guides)

### Governance Compliance
- [⚠] Complexity justified (hybrid architecture needed for optimal desktop UX - see Complexity Tracking)
- [✅] Simplicity principle maintained (minimal dependencies, clean architecture)
- [✅] All PRs verify constitution compliance (automated checks + manual review)

**Structure Decision**: Web application structure selected due to hybrid architecture: Go backend for eino agent and business logic, React frontend with shadcn/ui components for user interface, and Tauri Rust layer for desktop application functionality. This provides optimal separation of concerns while maintaining cross-platform compatibility.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research
1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:
   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts
*Prerequisites: research.md complete*

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/powershell/update-agent-context.ps1 -AgentType qwen`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach
*This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan*

**Task Generation Strategy**:
- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P] 
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:
- TDD order: Tests before implementation 
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation
*These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command*

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking
*Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified*

| Violation | Why Needed | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
|-----------|------------|-------------------------------------|
| Go-First Development deviation (Rust/Tauri/React frontend) | Optimal desktop UX requires rich interactive interface with real-time preview, which is better achieved with React ecosystem and Tauri's native integration. Go desktop GUI libraries are limited in capabilities and user experience. | Pure Go desktop application would provide inferior user experience, limited component ecosystem, and reduced developer productivity for complex UI requirements. |
| Multi-language architecture (Go + Rust + JavaScript) | Each layer serves distinct purpose: Go for AI agent/backend logic, Rust for system-level desktop integration, JavaScript/React for rich interactive UI. | Single-language approach would compromise either backend performance (JavaScript) or UI capabilities (Go) or desktop integration (pure JavaScript). |
