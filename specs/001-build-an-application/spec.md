# Feature Specification: Inspiration Source Blog Writer

**Feature Branch**: `001-build-an-application`  
**Created**: 2025-09-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "build an application that can help me write blog or something wrote in .md, and also could collect my input internet link blog and other information that i think is helpful, what the most impotent is to when i click the "IDEA ISPIRA" button , a agent would analysis those data and ask me in a chat to help me generate a "interest idea""

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a content creator, I want to write blog posts in Markdown format while collecting helpful internet links and information, so that when I click the "IDEA ISPIRA" button, an AI agent can analyze my collected data and engage me in a chat conversation to help generate interesting ideas for my content.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a user is writing a blog post in Markdown format, **When** they add internet links and helpful information to their collection, **Then** the system should store this information alongside their draft
2. **Given** a user has collected links and information in their current session, **When** they click the "IDEA ISPIRA" button, **Then** an AI agent should analyze the collected data and initiate a chat conversation to help generate interest ideas
3. **Given** an AI agent is analyzing collected data, **When** it presents generated ideas to the user, **Then** the user should be able to incorporate these ideas into their Markdown blog post

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the user clicks "IDEA ISPIRA" with no collected data?
- How does system handle invalid or broken internet links?
- What happens when the AI agent cannot generate relevant ideas from the collected data?
- How does system handle very large collections of links and information?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a Markdown editor for writing blog posts and other content
- **FR-002**: System MUST allow users to collect and store internet links, blog URLs, and other helpful information
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to click an "IDEA ISPIRA" button to trigger AI analysis
- **FR-004**: System MUST integrate an AI agent that can analyze collected links and information
- **FR-005**: AI agent MUST engage users in a chat conversation to help generate "interest ideas"
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to incorporate generated ideas back into their Markdown content
- **FR-007**: System MUST support offline functionality for core Markdown editing [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is offline mode required for all features or just editing?]
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist user data including drafts, collected links, and chat history [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What is the data retention policy and backup requirements?]
- **FR-009**: System MUST support multiple file formats for export [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Which export formats are required - Markdown, HTML, PDF, etc.?]
- **FR-010**: AI agent MUST provide real-time analysis and idea generation [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What are the performance expectations for AI response time?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Blog Draft**: Represents user's Markdown content with metadata (title, creation date, last modified, tags)
- **Collected Resource**: Represents internet links, blog URLs, and helpful information with source attribution and categorization
- **Interest Idea**: Represents AI-generated ideas with confidence score, source references, and user feedback
- **Chat Session**: Represents conversation history between user and AI agent with timestamps and message types
- **User Profile**: Represents user preferences, settings, and authentication information [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Is user authentication required?]
